Assignments

1. A web page
Please develop a website according to the provided wireframe.
Link :  Wireframe . 
Note: The link will only function after you sign in with Google, so please ensure you are logged in.
Git commits are mandatory.
Please ensure that you are developing a responsive design.
Your code should be easy to read and well-commented, adhering to all standard clean code principles.
Tech Stack: Only React or Angular should be used. If you have experience with both frameworks, please highlight this in your README file.
All code must be pushed to your GitHub account, and you should submit the link through the Microsoft form provided below.
Evaluators will have a minimum of one week for evaluation, and all submissions will be reviewed. If you do not receive a response after 10 days, please follow up.
Any image you feel broken, add any image. We evaluate the page structure, layout and your coding skills. 



2.  Building a Scalable RESTful API
Objective:
Create a RESTful API for a simple e-commerce application that manages products, users, and orders. The API should be scalable, secure, and follow best practices.
Requirements:
API Endpoints:
Users:
POST /users: Register a new user (username, password, email).
GET /users/{id}: Get user details.
PUT /users/{id}: Update user details.
DELETE /users/{id}: Delete a user.
Products:
GET /products: List all products with pagination.
POST /products: Create a new product (name, description, price, stock).
GET /products/{id}: Get product details.
PUT /products/{id}: Update product details.
DELETE /products/{id}: Delete a product.
Orders:
POST /orders: Create a new order (user ID, product IDs, quantities).
GET /orders/{id}: Get order details.
GET /users/{id}/orders: List all orders for a user.
Technology Stack:
Choose a backend framework (e.g., Express.js, Django, Spring Boot, nestJs, etc).
Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB).
Implement authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2).
Scalability Considerations:
Structure your codebase for scalability, modularity, and maintainability.
Use design patterns (e.g., Repository Pattern, Service Layer).
Consider caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
Security Best Practices:
Implement input validation and sanitization.
Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
Ensure password storage is secure (e.g., hashing with bcrypt).
Protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).



Thank You and All the best.
